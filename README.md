# Commit Calendar

We usually come across the commit calendars in GitHub or gitlab in our daily work.

Commit Calendar is a 2D calendar which provides information regarding the commits a user has done over a period of time (max the past year).

I was intrigued by it and thought if I could create it from scratch in Vanilla JS, so I started working on it.

And now after some considrable efforts, it's finally complete, and here is the demo.

Some of the key features:

- Commit Info on hover or by keyboard navigation
- Event delegation
- Uses CSS grid and CSS variables- Keyboard Navigable - with tabs and arrow keys
- Responsive for any screen size
